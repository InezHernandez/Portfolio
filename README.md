# Portfolio
Hello!

Welcome, this is my porfolio, a gathering of my coursework and some projects I have done for internships throughout my journey as a student.
I am passionate about social justice work, developing and using tech to work towards diversity and inclusion.
I am graduating at the end of Winter Term 2021 and hope to either work in software development, front end development, or data analytics.
I have a background in hardware and IT work. These other skills I have learned throughout my journey helps me more comprehensively understand software development needs and helps me identify issues with user facing software as well.
