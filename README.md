Hello!

Welcome, this is my porfolio, a gathering of my coursework and some projects I have done for internships throughout my journey as a student.
I am passionate about social justice work, developing and using tech to work towards diversity and inclusion.
I am graduating at the end of Winter Term 2021 and hope to either work in software development, front end development, or data analytics.
I have a background in hardware and IT work. These other skills I have learned throughout my journey helps me more comprehensively understand software development needs and helps me identify issues with user facing software as well.

Current Stages:
Took about 24 hours to figure out how to do the domain registration with domain.com and set up the hosting platform with GoogleCloud.Learned about domain ownership verification methods, had to try a few myself, learning about nameservers and DNS records and pointing those to load balancers. Learned about load balancers and how to redirect https traffic to http, though that is still a work in progress, currently only supports https traffic.

In the future:
Will be wanting to finish setting up the site as barebones and hopefully learn a bit of react to start incorporating some cool effects onto the site.

Risks:
Load time, will have to skim down code to minimize load time.
Also, looking into how to prevent bots and other traffic from pinging site to reduce traffic expense.
